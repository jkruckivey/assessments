# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is an educational resources repository focused on AI-driven assessment tools for higher education. It contains instructional design principles, templates, and research materials for building educational technology with AI assistance.

**NEW: This repository now includes a fully functional AI Assessment Bot (Flask web application) that can be deployed to Render for demonstration purposes.**

## Key Resources

### Instructional Design Principles
Located in `./Instructional Design Principles/`, this directory contains essential frameworks:
- **Universal Design for Learning (UDL)** - Accessibility and inclusive design guidelines
- **Quality Matters Standards** - Educational effectiveness and assessment alignment
- **Inclusive Teaching Technology** - Cultural sensitivity and diverse learner support
- **Prompt Engineering Guide** - Best practices for AI tool development
- **Assessment Tool Templates** - Ready-to-use starting points for educational tools

### Subject Matter Resources
The `./Subject Matter Resources/` directory contains academic papers and guides on:
- Generative AI in assessment and higher education
- Academic integrity with AI
- Alternative assessment frameworks
- Student engagement strategies

### Quick Reference Materials
Available in `./Instructional Design Principles/Quick Reference/`:
- **Prompt Library** - Copy-paste prompts for common educational tool tasks
- **Troubleshooting Checklist** - Solutions to frequent development challenges

## Development Guidelines

When creating educational tools or assessments:
1. Apply UDL principles for accessibility - multiple means of representation, engagement, and expression
2. Follow Quality Matters standards for clear learning objectives and aligned assessments
3. Ensure cultural inclusivity and diverse perspectives
4. Implement WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for accessibility
5. Design for mobile responsiveness and cross-platform compatibility

## Common Tasks

### Creating Assessment Tools
Reference `./Instructional Design Principles/Tool Templates/Assessment-Tool-Templates.md` for:
- Quiz and test structures
- Rubric-based assessments
- Self-assessment frameworks
- Peer review systems

### Implementing Inclusive Design
Use the Inclusive Teaching Technology guide when:
- Adding culturally diverse examples
- Supporting multiple participation styles
- Ensuring language clarity
- Addressing accessibility needs

### Working with AI Development
The Prompt Engineering Guide provides:
- CLEAR framework for structured prompts
- Educational context integration patterns
- Iterative development approaches

## Collaboration Workflow

The COLLABORATION-GUIDE.md outlines how to leverage these resources effectively:
1. User provides vision and objectives
2. User specifies standards (UDL, QM, inclusive teaching)
3. Reference appropriate framework documents
4. Iterate based on institutional needs

## AI Assessment Bot Application

### Application Structure
- **`app.py`** - Flask web application with Claude 4.5 Sonnet integration
- **`templates/chat.html`** - Responsive chat interface with quick-start prompts
- **`requirements.txt`** - Python dependencies (Flask, anthropic, gunicorn, etc.)
- **`render.yaml`** - Render deployment configuration
- **`test_bot.py`** - Test suite for verifying functionality
- **`README-DEPLOYMENT.md`** - Complete deployment guide

### Bot Capabilities
- **Knowledge Base Integration** - Automatically loads all markdown files from Instructional Design Principles
- **Assessment Guidance** - Provides expert advice on UDL, Quality Matters, and inclusive design
- **Conversation Memory** - Maintains context within chat sessions
- **Quick Start Options** - Pre-built prompts for common assessment scenarios
- **Mobile Responsive** - Works on all devices

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Test locally (after pip install -r requirements.txt)
python app.py

# Test functionality
python test_bot.py

# Deploy to Render
# 1. Push to GitHub
# 2. Connect repository to Render Web Service
# 3. Add CLAUDE_API_KEY environment variable
# 4. Deploy automatically uses render.yaml configuration
```

### Environment Variables Required
- **CLAUDE_API_KEY** - Anthropic Claude API key (set in Render dashboard)
- **SECRET_KEY** - Flask session secret (auto-generated by Render)

### Technical Specifications
- **Model** - Claude 4.5 Sonnet (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)
- **Framework** - Flask with Gunicorn
- **Platform** - Render Web Service
- **Python** - 3.11.9
- **Cost** - ~$10-57/month (Render + Claude API usage)

## Important Notes

- **Dual Purpose Repository** - Educational resources + functional web application
- All educational tools should prioritize accessibility and inclusivity
- Resources are designed for Ivey Business School EdTech Lab context
- Materials focus on business education and MBA programs
- **Bot demonstrates practical application** of the educational frameworks
