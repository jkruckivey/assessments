This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is an educational resources repository focused on AI-driven assessment tools for higher education. It contains instructional design principles, templates, and research materials for building educational technology with AI assistance.

## Key Resources

### Instructional Design Principles
Located in `./Instructional Design Principles/`, this directory contains essential frameworks:
- **Universal Design for Learning (UDL)** - Accessibility and inclusive design guidelines
- **Quality Matters Standards** - Educational effectiveness and assessment alignment
- **Inclusive Teaching Technology** - Cultural sensitivity and diverse learner support
- **Prompt Engineering Guide** - Best practices for AI tool development
- **Assessment Tool Templates** - Ready-to-use starting points for educational tools

### Subject Matter Resources
The `./Subject Matter Resources/` directory contains academic papers and guides on:
- Generative AI in assessment and higher education
- Academic integrity with AI
- Alternative assessment frameworks
- Student engagement strategies

### Quick Reference Materials
Available in `./Instructional Design Principles/Quick Reference/`:
- **Prompt Library** - Copy-paste prompts for common educational tool tasks
- **Troubleshooting Checklist** - Solutions to frequent development challenges

## Development Guidelines

When creating educational tools or assessments:
1. Apply UDL principles for accessibility - multiple means of representation, engagement, and expression
2. Follow Quality Matters standards for clear learning objectives and aligned assessments
3. Ensure cultural inclusivity and diverse perspectives
4. Implement WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for accessibility
5. Design for mobile responsiveness and cross-platform compatibility

## Common Tasks

### Creating Assessment Tools
Reference `./Instructional Design Principles/Tool Templates/Assessment-Tool-Templates.md` for:
- Quiz and test structures
- Rubric-based assessments
- Self-assessment frameworks
- Peer review systems

### Implementing Inclusive Design
Use the Inclusive Teaching Technology guide when:
- Adding culturally diverse examples
- Supporting multiple participation styles
- Ensuring language clarity
- Addressing accessibility needs

### Working with AI Development
The Prompt Engineering Guide provides:
- CLEAR framework for structured prompts
- Educational context integration patterns
- Iterative development approaches

## Collaboration Workflow

The COLLABORATION-GUIDE.md outlines how to leverage these resources effectively:
1. User provides vision and objectives
2. User specifies standards (UDL, QM, inclusive teaching)
3. Reference appropriate framework documents
4. Iterate based on institutional needs

## Important Notes

- This is a resource repository, not a code project - no build/test commands needed
- All educational tools should prioritize accessibility and inclusivity
- Resources are designed for Ivey Business School EdTech Lab context
- Materials focus on business education and MBA programs
