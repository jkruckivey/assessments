## üö® Emergency Quick Fixes

### Tool Won't Load or is Broken
**Try this first:**
1. **Refresh the page** - Clear cache with Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. **Check browser console** - Press F12, look for red error messages
3. **Try different browser** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
4. **Check internet connection** - Test with other websites

**Ask Claude Code:**
```
"My tool isn't loading properly. Here's the error message: [paste error]. 
Can you help me fix this step by step?"
```

### Features Not Working as Expected
**Quick diagnostic:**
1. **Test on mobile** - Many issues are device-specific
2. **Try without browser extensions** - Ad blockers can interfere
3. **Check if it's one feature** - Isolate the problem area
4. **Test with different user inputs** - Invalid data can break tools

**Ask Claude Code:**
```
"The [specific feature] isn't working correctly. When I [describe action], 
it should [expected result] but instead [actual result]. Here's my code: [paste code]"
```

## üîß Development Problems

### Claude Code Not Understanding My Prompts

**Symptoms:**
- Generic tools that don't match your educational needs
- Missing key features you requested
- Overly complex or overly simple results

**Quick Fix:**
Make your prompts more specific using the CLEAR framework:

```
Instead of: "Create a quiz tool"
Try: "Create a financial analysis quiz for MBA students that helps them practice 
ROI calculations with immediate feedback and progress tracking. Include keyboard 
navigation and mobile-responsive design."
```

**Better Prompt Template:**
```
Create a [specific tool type] for [specific user group] that helps them [specific learning objective].

Must include:
- [Essential feature 1]
- [Essential feature 2]
- [Accessibility requirement]
- [Technical requirement]

Success criteria: [How will users know they succeeded?]
```

### Tool Missing Educational Focus

**Symptoms:**
- Looks like generic app, not learning tool
- No connection to learning objectives
- Missing feedback or assessment features

**Quick Fix:**
Add educational elements to existing tool:

```
"Add educational features to this tool:
- Clear learning objectives displayed to users
- Progress tracking toward specific skills
- Immediate feedback that explains correct answers
- Self-reflection prompts for metacognitive development
- Connection to real-world applications"
```

### Accessibility Problems

**Common Issues:**
- Can't navigate with keyboard only
- Poor color contrast
- Missing alt text for images
- Confusing for screen readers

**Quick Fix:**
```
"Make this tool fully accessible by adding:
- Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Arrow keys)
- ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- Alt text for images and icons
- High contrast color mode option
- Screen reader compatible headings and structure
Test it by navigating without using a mouse."
```

**Quick Test:**
1. **Tab through entire interface** - Can you reach everything?
2. **Use high contrast mode** - Is text still readable?
3. **Zoom to 200%** - Does layout still work?
4. **Test with screen reader** - Use browser's built-in reader
