## üí° Philosophy Behind This Pack

### Education-First Approach
**Technology serves learning, not the reverse.** Every tool should solve a real educational challenge and enhance the learning experience.

### Accessibility by Design
**Universal access isn't optional.** Tools should work for all learners regardless of technical skill, device type, or accessibility needs.

### Sustainable Innovation
**Start simple, grow thoughtfully.** Begin with basic functionality and add complexity based on actual user needs.

### Evidence-Based Decisions
**Research guides design.** Educational tools should be grounded in learning science and validated through user feedback.
