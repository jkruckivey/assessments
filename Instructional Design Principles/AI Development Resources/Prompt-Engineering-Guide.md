## üéØ What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the skill of communicating clearly and effectively with AI to get the results you want. For educational tool development, this means writing prompts that produce learning-focused, accessible, and pedagogically sound applications.

### Core Principle
**"The quality of your prompt directly determines the quality of your educational tool."**

A well-crafted prompt is like a detailed brief to a skilled developer who understands education - the clearer your instructions, the better the result.

## üß† Understanding Claude Code's Strengths

### What Claude Code Excels At:
- **Web applications** - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and simple backend functionality
- **Educational focus** - Understanding learning objectives and pedagogical principles
- **Accessibility** - Building inclusive, WCAG-compliant interfaces
- **Rapid prototyping** - Creating working applications quickly for testing and iteration
- **Code explanation** - Helping you understand what it built and how to modify it

### What to Keep Realistic:
- **Complex integrations** - LMS connections, advanced APIs may require additional development
- **Large-scale applications** - Better for focused tools than comprehensive platforms
- **Real-time collaboration** - Simple sharing works better than complex multi-user features
- **Advanced security** - Great for educational tools, may need enhancement for sensitive data

## ‚ö° Advanced Prompting Techniques

### Technique 1: Iterative Refinement
**Start broad, then get specific through follow-up prompts**

**Initial Prompt:**
```
Create a time management tool for students that uses the Pomodoro Technique.
```

**Follow-up Prompts:**
```
1. "Add customizable timer intervals - some students need 45-minute focus sessions instead of 25."
2. "Include a task prioritization matrix based on urgency and importance."
3. "Add analytics showing focus patterns and productivity trends."
4. "Create a gamification system with achievements for consistent use."
```

### Technique 2: Role-Based Prompting
**Ask Claude Code to consider specific perspectives**

```
As an instructional designer focused on accessibility, create a [tool] that ensures 
students with diverse learning needs can successfully [achieve objective].

Consider perspectives of:
- Visual learners who need diagrams and color coding
- Auditory learners who prefer spoken instructions
- Kinesthetic learners who need hands-on interaction
- Students with ADHD who benefit from structured, distraction-free interfaces
- Non-native speakers who need clear, simple language
```

### Technique 3: Constraint-Based Prompting
**Define limitations to focus creativity**

```
Create a [tool] that works within these constraints:
- Must load in under 3 seconds on 3G connection
- Cannot require user accounts or login
- Must work on smartphones with small screens
- Should use no more than 5 colors total
- Must be understandable by 15-year-olds

These constraints should lead to creative solutions that are accessible and user-friendly.
```

### Technique 4: Example-Driven Prompting
**Provide specific examples of desired functionality**

```
Create a peer feedback tool. Here's what good feedback looks like in this context:

Example 1: "Your introduction clearly states the problem, but consider adding 
specific data to support the urgency. The solution section would benefit from 
addressing potential counter-arguments."

Example 2: "Strong use of financial analysis. The NPV calculation is correct, 
but explain why you chose a 10% discount rate. Consider how different rates 
might affect your recommendation."

Build the tool to help students give feedback at this level of specificity and professionalism.
```

## üöÄ Troubleshooting Common Prompt Problems

### Problem 1: Tool Lacks Educational Focus
**Symptoms:** Claude Code creates generic app without learning integration
**Solution:** Always include specific learning objectives and success criteria

**Instead of:**
```
Create a flashcard app for students.
```

**Try:**
```
Create a flashcard app that helps students move from memorization to application. 
Include spaced repetition algorithms, self-testing features, and prompts that 
require students to explain concepts in their own words and connect to real-world examples.
```

### Problem 2: Too Complex for Target Users
**Symptoms:** Tool has too many features or confusing interface
**Solution:** Specify user experience level and progressive disclosure

**Instead of:**
```
Create a comprehensive project management tool for student teams.
```

**Try:**
```
Create a simple project management tool for undergraduate students who may have 
no prior experience with project management software. Start with basic task 
assignment and deadline tracking. Hide advanced features unless requested.
```

### Problem 3: Not Accessible by Default
**Symptoms:** Tool works only for users without accessibility needs
**Solution:** Make accessibility requirements explicit and specific

**Instead of:**
```
Make sure the tool is accessible.
```

**Try:**
```
Ensure the tool meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards, specifically:
- All interactive elements are keyboard navigable
- Color contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text
- Proper heading structure for screen readers
- Alternative text for all images and icons
- Forms have clear labels and error messages
```

### Problem 4: Doesn't Match Educational Standards
**Symptoms:** Tool creates busy work rather than meaningful learning
**Solution:** Reference specific educational frameworks and evidence-based practices

**Instead of:**
```
Create an engaging learning game.
```

**Try:**
```
Create a learning game that follows UDL principles and supports specific learning 
objectives. Ensure the game mechanics directly support skill development rather 
than providing entertainment. Include assessment rubrics that measure actual 
learning, not just engagement.
```

## üí° Expert Tips for Educational Tool Prompts

### Tip 1: Lead with Learning, Not Technology
**Focus on what students should achieve, then specify how technology can help**

### Tip 2: Be Specific About Context
**"MBA students analyzing Fortune 500 cases" is much better than "business students"**

### Tip 3: Include Failure Scenarios  
**Specify what should happen when students make mistakes or need help**

### Tip 4: Think Mobile-First
**Many students primarily use phones - design for small screens and touch interactions**

### Tip 5: Plan for Iteration
**Your first version won't be perfect - write prompts that facilitate improvement**

### Tip 6: Consider the Full Learning Journey
**How does this tool fit into broader course goals and assessment strategies?**
