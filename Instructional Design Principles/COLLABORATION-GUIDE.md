# Collaboration Guide: Using the Starter Pack

*How to leverage these resources when working with Claude on educational projects*

---

## üéØ Purpose of This Starter Pack

This collection serves as a **shared knowledge base** for our collaborative work on educational projects. When you ask me to "make it inclusive" or "add UDL principles" or "follow Quality Matters standards," I'll draw from these resources to ensure consistent, research-backed implementation.

### How This Works:
- **You provide the vision** - "Create a course on X" or "Build a tool for Y"
- **You specify standards** - "Make it UDL compliant" or "Follow inclusive teaching practices"  
- **I reference these resources** - Apply specific frameworks and best practices
- **We iterate together** - Refine based on your expertise and institutional needs
